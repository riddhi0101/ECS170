##-- NOTE THAT THE COMMENTING DONE BELOW IS NOT HOW WE WANT YOU TO
##-- COMMENT YOUR PROGRAMS.  THINK OF THESE OVERLY WORDY COMMENTS
##-- AS A MINI-LECTURE ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS, NOT AS AN
##-- EXAMPLE OF CONCISE DOCUMENTATION.
##--
##-- Note also that what's below isn't the best example of Python
##-- programming. I adapted this program from another program I had
##-- written in Haskell (and a previous version written in Scheme).
##-- Those are functional languages, and Python mostly isn't, but
##-- in trying to maintain the functional-ness as much as possible,
##-- I have ended up with code that is a bit quirky, to say the least.
##-- Plus, I haven't fully taken advantage of Python's string handling
##-- capabilities, so that adds to the quirkiness.
##--
##-- On the other hand, it works.  But I should scrap a lot of this
##-- and write it from scratch. As Fred Brooks (famous software
##-- engineering guru and author of "The Mythical Man-Month")
##-- says, "Throw the first one away."
##--
##-- Let's begin...
##--
##-- A version of something known as the peg puzzle consists of four pegs
##-- (two blue and two red) and six holes.  Each of the holes may hold one
##-- peg.  Initially the two red pegs are in the left-most holes, and the
##-- two blue pegs are in the right-most holes.  (Note that the example in
##-- class used only one hole, not two.  That just allows the diagrams to
##-- fit on a single PowerPoint slide better.  Makes no real difference.)
##--
##-- The object of this puzzle (and remember that it's a puzzle with one person
##-- playing, not a game with two opponents), is to put the red pegs in the
##-- right-most holes and the blue pegs in the left-most holes by moving one
##-- peg at a time according to the following rules:
##--
##--    A peg may be moved into an adjacent empty hole.
##--    A peg may jump over a single peg of another color into an empty hole.
##--    The blue pegs may only move or jump to the left.
##--    The red pegs may only move or jump to the right.
##--
##-- For this problem, we'll represent the current state of the puzzle as
##-- a String, and the pegs by letters representing the color of the peg
##-- B = blue, R = red, and _ = and empty hole
##--
##-- So the initial state described above is "RR__BB"
##--
##-- Below is the typical state space search algorithm implemented in
##-- Python.

def pegpuzzle(start, goal):
    return reverse(statesearch([start], goal, []))


def statesearch(unexplored, goal, path):
    if unexplored == []:
        return []
    elif goal == head(unexplored):
        return cons(goal, path)
    else:
        result = statesearch(generateNewStates(head(unexplored)),
                             goal,
                             cons(head(unexplored), path))
        if result != []:
            return result
        else:
            return statesearch(tail(unexplored),
                               goal,
                               path)


##-- Now we have to generate all the next states that can be reached
##-- from the current state in one move.  This is sometimes called
##-- move-generation.

##-- So what moves do we want to generate?  How will that work?
##-- First, let's take a look at the starting state.  It looks like
##-- this: "RR__BB"
##-- From any given state, there are at most four different types of
##-- moves that could be made:
##--  a red piece could slide one spot to the right into an adjacent empty spot
##--  a red piece could jump to the right over a blue piece into an empty spot
##--    just past the blue piece
##--  a blue piece could slide one spot to the left into an adjacent empty spot
##--  a blue piece could jump to the left over a red piece into an empty spot
##--    just past the red piece
##--
##-- So in order to generate all the moves possible from a given state,
##-- we want to apply four different move-generators to that state, one
##-- for each type of move.  And then we'd like to combine the results of
##-- those four move-generators into a single list to be used by the
##-- top-level peg-puzzle function.  Going back to our start state,
##-- if we apply the first move-generator described, we should see
##-- this state generated: "R_R_BB"
##-- And if we apply the second move-generator, we shouldn't see any
##-- states generated, because there are no jumps that a red piece
##-- can make.
##-- Applying the third move-generator would give this state: "RR_B_B",
##-- and applying the fourth move-generator would generate no new states,
##-- because there are no jumps for a blue piece either.
##--
##-- It will be useful to keep in mind as we go that, at least for this
##-- particular puzzle, the movement of blue pieces is exactly the same
##-- as the movement of red pieces, except the blue pieces travel in the
##-- opposite direction.  This suggests that we only need to worry about
##-- solving the move-generation problem for the red pieces.  Then when
##-- it comes time to deal with the blue pieces, we can just reverse
##-- the list that represents the current state, apply the move-generators
##-- for the red pieces, and then reverse the results.
##--
##-- So let's take a look at move-generation for red pieces.  We'll start
##-- with sliding red pieces one space to the right to an empty space.
##-- To do this, we'll want to look at the current state starting at the
##-- left end and proceeding to the right, and every time we see a
##-- portion of that String that looks like "R_", we'll want to replace
##-- that pair of elements with "_R", and return the resulting String as
##-- a new possible state.  At the heart of this, we'll want a function
##-- that takes a String as an argument, a position number (starting with 0
##-- for the first element in the list), and a segment of pieces and
##-- spaces to replace what's already in the list.  For example,
##-- we might call this function "replaceSegment", and it would work
##-- like this:
##-- >>> replaceSegment("RR__BB",1,"_R") => "R_R_BB"
##--
##-- Here's what that function looks like:

def replaceSegment(oldList, pos, segment):
    return oldList[0:pos] + segment + oldList[(pos + len(segment)):]


##-- Now we'd like to be able to use what we just wrote as we scoot along
##-- a String representing a state, testing to see if we find "R_" at
##-- each spot and replacing that segment with "_R" if we do.  So this
##-- new function might be calledlike this and return a list of new states:
##-- >>> generateNewRedSlides("R_R_BB") => ["_RR_BB","R__RBB"]
##--
##-- Here's what that function looks like:

def generateNewRedSlides(currState):
    return generateNew(currState, 0, "R_", "_R")


def generateNew(currState, pos, oldSegment, newSegment):
    result = []
    for i in range(pos, len(currState) - 1):
        if segmentEqual(currState, i, oldSegment):
            result.append(replaceSegment(currState, i, newSegment))
    return result


##-- To make the functions above work, we need to be able to compare
##-- a specified segment of one String to another String, character by
##-- character, to see if they're the same, before we do the replacement.
##-- This is similar to a subseq or subsequence function, but not
##-- quite the same.

def segmentEqual(currState, pos, oldSegment):
    return (oldSegment == take(len(oldSegment), drop(pos, currState)))


##-- We've done pretty much all the hard work now.  To generate
##-- the red jumps that are possible, we just re-use most of
##-- what we've already created but pass different arguments:

def generateNewRedJumps(currState):
    return generateNew(currState, 0, "RB_", "_BR")


##-- Now to make the blue slides and the blue jumps, we just have
##-- to reverse the String that is the currState as we pass it
##-- into our move-generators, and then we also have to reverse
##-- the individual Strings that are generated:

def generateNewBlueSlides(currState):
    return reverseEach(generateNew(reverse(currState), 0, "B_", "_B"))


def generateNewBlueJumps(currState):
    return reverseEach(generateNew(reverse(currState), 0, "BR_", "_RB"))


def reverseEach(listOfLists):
    result = []
    for st in listOfLists:
        result.append(reverse(st))
    return result


##-- Here are some simple utility functions to give names to
##-- some of the list operations (borrowed from functional
##-- programming):

def reverse(st):
    return st[::-1]


def head(lst):
    return lst[0]


def tail(lst):
    return lst[1:]


def take(n, lst):
    return lst[0:n]


def drop(n, lst):
    return lst[n:]


def cons(item, lst):
    return [item] + lst


##-- And finally, we need to be able to tie all these move generators together
##-- to create one big list of next possible moves:
##

def generateNewStates(currState):
    return (generateNewRedSlides(currState) + generateNewRedJumps(currState) +
            generateNewBlueSlides(currState) + generateNewBlueJumps(currState))

##-- That wasn't so hard, was it?  Here's the whole thing in action with
##-- one hole.  Add a second hole and it should work just fine.
